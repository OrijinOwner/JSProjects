//Tell JS to change a data type from one to another 


let a = 9;
let b = "9";
let c = a + b;
console.log('Answer'  +c)



// In the above example, JS trated both as string values or text values and is literally combining 9+9 to create 99. 

//JS realises it cannot add a number and string together. STRING always wins!
